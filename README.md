# Neural-Engineering-Framework-Control-Systems
3rd year EEE project. The idea is to create and compare real-time neural control systems. 3 neural networks are created, an ANN trained with GD and BP, another using NEAT, and an SNN created using Nengo, utilising the NEF. Finally, these will be compared to traditional PID. 
The first task is 1 Player pong, controlling a paddle to avoid letting the ball hit the left-hand wall. Progress is going quickly, so if completed in good time, I will also look into creating a pendulum balancing environment, potentially a double pendulum after that.

The goal of this project is education. Firstly: learning how traditional neural networks are created and familiarising myself with associated python libraries. Secondly: Understanding the Neural Engineering Framework using Nengo as I read "Neural Engineering (Chris Eliasmith and Charles H Anderson, 2003)"
