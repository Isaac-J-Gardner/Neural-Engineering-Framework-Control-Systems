# Neural-Engineering-Framework-Control-Systems
3rd year EEE project. The idea is to compare real-time neural control systems. 3 neural networks are created, an ANN trained with GD and BP, another using NEAT, and an SNN created using Nengo, utilising the NEF. Finally, these will be compared to traditional PID.
